## üîó Description <a name = "description"></a>

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users‚Äô financial information.

This week I will update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Once I‚Äôve made these changes, I‚Äôll deploy the application to Heroku. [See Live Application](https://young-shore-73823.herokuapp.com/)
